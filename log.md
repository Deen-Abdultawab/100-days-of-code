# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 12, 2022 (Example 1)


**Today's Progress**: Forked 100DaysoFCode repository from github, learnt how to clone a repository using Github Desktop, and git bash. Also created a new branch. Will be commiting my projects there.

**Thoughts:** Had a tough time settling for which method to use for git cloning, git bash or git desktop or VScode terminal. Finally settled on Github desktop but learnt all the other methods.


### Day 2: August 13, 2022 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Built a JavaScript counter.

**Thoughts**: I decided to start with the simplest one for cofidence. Didn't have much problem on this particular project.
